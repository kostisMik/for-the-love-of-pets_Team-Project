TRAINER'S TIPS 
-----------------------
 By Spyro :

- sophisticated search. more than name and ids, behavior of animal, usual habits, natural habitat.
- all above in PROPERTIESof pets.
- adopted and homebred pets(ston xwro mas) should be apart.
- specific vacancies (good start 50).

- jQuery has ready-made calendars and marks days and dates. (available and whatnot for reservations).

- separate animals with an extra column that specifies if it IS or NOT for adoption or hosting.
- take care of photos. don't need to load them in db.

- if someone finds a stray?

NAVBAR model: ADOPTION | HOSTING | I FOUND STRAY.

- user ticks , marks or whteverpoints on map where strays were found ( and we found them ).


we need ADMIN to do the crud.
we need user to be able and adopt and host ( no need for further roles, nicee !! ).

-there may be different admins(doctorAdmin_ for Example).

we need to specify the whole of the place as an ENTITY (its destination).
