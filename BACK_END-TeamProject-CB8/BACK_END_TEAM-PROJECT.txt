	question to team: 
	1) register / login : 
		>> ? what form will it have?
		>> would benefit to be a link so as to begin the "controller path" from a get request and everything POSTED from there.

	2) get consultation on working with POSTMAN from the beginning.


	3) CONSIDER header and footer being autonomous and load from .jsp.
